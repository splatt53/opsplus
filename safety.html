                    <h1>Safety</h1>
                    <p>Ops Plus is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. We have developed what we believe to be a top-rate safety program with a commitment from upper management that is felt by every Ops Plus employee. The program is led by our Safety Coordinator, along with a six-member safety committee. Participation and involvement are expected from all employees.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that accident prevention, productivity and quality go hand in hand. At Ops Plus, our high standards mean it is the entire team’s responsibility to ensure the workplace and all work sites are as safe as possible. We are all accountable for observing and reporting safety concerns, and we work daily to instill an attitude of a “Total Safety Culture.” Some of the elements of our program include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Employee safety goals and objectives</li>
                        <li>Vehicle safety policy, including vehicle audits</li>
                        <li>Personal protective equipment policy</li>
                        <li>Safety training policy</li>
                        <li>Drug & alcohol policies</li>
                        <li>Site- or contractor-specific training</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Safety is essential to providing quality customer service. A safe work culture provides Ops Plus with a competitive advantage by optimizing productivity, preventing operating losses, retaining employees and improving morale.</p>
                    <p>Ops Plus' safety program is led by a full-time safety professional professional who has a background in OSHA standards, First Aid and CPR, Global Safety standards, safety investigation and reporting, and more.</p>
